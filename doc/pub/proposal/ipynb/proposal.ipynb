    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "For nuclear theorists, the overarching\n",
    "challenge is to develop a comprehensive description of nuclei and\n",
    "their reactions, grounded in the fundamental interactions between the\n",
    "constituent nucleons with quantifiable uncertainties to maximize\n",
    "predictive power.  As experimental frontiers have shifted to the study\n",
    "of rare isotopes, the predictive power of successful phenomenological\n",
    "approaches like the shell model and density functional theory is\n",
    "challenged by the scarcity of nearby experimental data to constrain\n",
    "model parameters. Therefore, it is expected that few-body and many-body methods\n",
    "will play an increasingly prominent role to help improve the\n",
    "predictive power of such \"data driven\" methods as experiment moves\n",
    "deeper into largely unexplored regions of the nuclear chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why nuclear matter is stable, and thereby shed light on\n",
    "the limits of nuclear stability, is one of the overarching aims and\n",
    "intellectual challenges of basic research in nuclear physics. To\n",
    "relate the stability of matter to the underlying fundamental forces\n",
    "and particles of nature as manifested in nuclear matter, is central to\n",
    "present and planned rare isotope facilities.  From a\n",
    "theoretical standpoint, this involves understanding how the basic\n",
    "building blocks of Nature interact and conspire to build up atomic\n",
    "nuclei as we know them, with the aim to understand what makes visible\n",
    "matter stable.  The theoretical efforts span from methods like Lattice\n",
    "Quantum Chromodynamics, via effective field theories to many-body\n",
    "theories applied to atomic nuclei and infinite nuclear matter. All\n",
    "these methods rely on theoretical approximations whose applicabilities\n",
    "are often limited by the dimensionality of the specific problem being\n",
    "studied. In recent years there has been considerable progress in our\n",
    "theoretical understanding of algorithms from quantum information theories\n",
    "applied to interacting systems, with the hope to circumvent many of\n",
    "the traditional dimensionality problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal for a Nuclear Talent schoold aims at bringing together the efforts of nuclear many-body theorists,\n",
    "quantum information theorists and mathematicians in order to \n",
    "present and discuss algorithms for studying nuclear systems\n",
    "using recent progress in quantum information theory."

    "institutions and aims at developing a broad curriculum that will\n",
    "provide the platform for a cutting-edge theory for understanding\n",
    "nuclei and nuclear reactions. These objectives will be met by offering\n",
    "series of lectures, commissioned from experienced teachers in nuclear\n",
    "theory and experiemt. The educational material generated under this program will be\n",
    "collected in the form of WEB-based courses, textbooks, and a variety\n",

    "* During the school, on-line and lecture-based training tailored to technical issues will be provided. Students will learn to use and interpret the results of computer-based and hand calculations of quantum computing algorithms. The lectures will be aligned with the practical computational projects and exercises and the lecturers will be available to help students and work with them during the exercise sessions.  \n",

    "* These interactions will raise topics not originally envisioned for the course but which are recognized to be valuable for the students. There will be flexibility to organize mini-lectures and discussion sessions on an ad-hoc basis in such cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each group of students will maintain an online logbook of their activities and results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Training modules, codes, lectures, practical exercise instructions, online logbooks, instructions and information created by participants will be merged into a comprehensive website that will be available to the community and the public for self-guided training or for use in various educational settings (for example, a graduate course at a university could assign some of the projects as homework or an extra credit project, etc)."
