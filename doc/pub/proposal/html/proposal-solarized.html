<h2 id="proposal-for-a-nuclear-talent-course-at-the-ect-in-2025">Proposal for a Nuclear Talent course at the ECT* in 2025 </h2>

<p>We would like to propose a three-week Nuclear Talent course on theory
for exploring quantum computing and quantum information science
applied to nuclear physics at the ECT* for the summer of 2025.  We
believe such a course has a strong potential to attract many students,
theorists and experimentalists alike.
</p>

<p>Below we give a short motivation for the proposed course and the
rationale behind the Nuclear Talent initiative. Thereafter we detail
our course plans with learning outcomes, objectives and teaching
philosophy, as well as various organizational and practical matters.
</p>

<p>The teaching teams consists of quantum computing theorists and nuclear
theorists, with expertise ranging from many-body methods to quantum
field theories. Several of us have developed courses on quantum
computing and/or taught similar courses, in addition to our ongoing research on
quantum computing. This  spans from quantum engineering to
developments of new algorithms and error correction studies.  We
believe such a mix is important as it gives the students a better
understanding on how quantum computing can be applied to nuclear
physics problems, and what are the limitations and possibilities in
understanding and interpreting the various algorithms on present and
planned quantum technologies.
</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation </h2>

<p>For nuclear theorists, the overarching
challenge is to develop a comprehensive description of nuclei and
their reactions, grounded in the fundamental interactions between the
constituent nucleons with quantifiable uncertainties to maximize
predictive power.  As experimental frontiers have shifted to the study
of rare isotopes, the predictive power of successful phenomenological
approaches like the shell model and density functional theory is
challenged by the scarcity of nearby experimental data to constrain
model parameters. Therefore, it is expected that few-body and many-body methods
will play an increasingly prominent role to help improve the
predictive power of such &quot;data driven&quot; methods as experiment moves
deeper into largely unexplored regions of the nuclear chart.
</p>

<p>To understand why nuclear matter is stable, and thereby shed light on
the limits of nuclear stability, is one of the overarching aims and
intellectual challenges of basic research in nuclear physics. To
relate the stability of matter to the underlying fundamental forces
and particles of nature as manifested in nuclear matter, is central to
present and planned rare isotope facilities.  From a
theoretical standpoint, this involves understanding how the basic
building blocks of Nature interact and conspire to build up atomic
nuclei as we know them, with the aim to understand what makes visible
matter stable.  The theoretical efforts span from methods like Lattice
Quantum Chromodynamics, via effective field theories to many-body
theories applied to atomic nuclei and infinite nuclear matter. All
these methods rely on theoretical approximations whose applicabilities
are often limited by the dimensionality of the specific problem being
studied. In recent years there has been considerable progress in our
theoretical understanding of algorithms from quantum information theories
applied to interacting systems, with the hope to circumvent many of
the traditional dimensionality problems.
</p>

<p>This proposal for a Nuclear Talent schoold aims at bringing together the efforts of nuclear many-body theorists,
quantum information theorists and mathematicians in order to 
present and discuss algorithms for studying nuclear systems
using recent progress in quantum information theory. 
</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-the-talent-courses">Introduction to the Talent Courses </h2>

<p>The TALENT initiative, <a href="http://www.nucleartalent.org" target="_blank">Training in Advanced Low Energy
Nuclear Theory</a>, aims at providing an
advanced and comprehensive training to graduate students and young
researchers in low-energy nuclear theory. The initiative is a
multinational network between several European and Northern American
institutions and aims at developing a broad curriculum that will
provide the platform for a cutting-edge theory for understanding
nuclei and nuclear reactions. These objectives will be met by offering
series of lectures, commissioned from experienced teachers in nuclear
theory and experiemt. The educational material generated under this program will be
collected in the form of WEB-based courses, textbooks, and a variety
of modern educational resources. No such all-encompassing material is
available at present; its development will allow dispersed university
groups to profit from the best expertise available.
</p>

<p>The Nuclear Talent initiative has organized and run
several advanced courses since the summer of 2012. Several of
these courses have been run and organized (in a very successful way)
at the premises of the ECT*. We hope thus, if this course gets
approved by the board of directors of the ECT*, that we can continue
this successful and very fruitful collaboration.
</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="aims-and-learning-outcomes">Aims and Learning Outcomes </h2>
<h3 id="format">Format: </h3>

<p>We propose approximately forty-five hours of lectures over three weeks and a
comparable amount of practical computer and exercise sessions, including the
setting of individual problems and the organization of various individual projects.
</p>

<p>The mornings will consist of lectures and the
afternoons will be devoted to exercises meant to shed light on the exposed theory, 
the computational projects  and individual student projects. These
components will be coordinated to foster student engagement,
maximize learning and create lasting value for the students. For the
benefit of the TALENT series and of the community, material (courses,
slides, problems and solutions, reports on students' projects) will be
made publicly available using version control software like <em>git</em> and posted electronically on 
<a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">github</a>. 
</p>

<p>As with previous TALENT courses, we envision
the following features for the afternoon sessions: 
</p>
<ul>
<li> We will use both individual and group work to carry out tasks that are very specific in technical instructions, but leave freedom for creativity.</li>  
<li> Groups will be carefully put together to maximize diversity of backgrounds.</li>  
<li> Results will be presented in a conference-like setting to create accountability.</li>  
<li> We will organize events where individuals and groups exchange their experiences, difficulties and successes to foster interaction.</li>  
<li> During the school, on-line and lecture-based training tailored to technical issues will be provided. Students will learn to use and interpret the results of computer-based and hand calculations of quantum computing algorithms. The lectures will be aligned with the practical computational projects and exercises and the lecturers will be available to help students and work with them during the exercise sessions.</li>  
<li> These interactions will raise topics not originally envisioned for the course but which are recognized to be valuable for the students. There will be flexibility to organize mini-lectures and discussion sessions on an ad-hoc basis in such cases.</li>  
<li> Each group of students will maintain an online logbook of their activities and results.</li>  
<li> Training modules, codes, lectures, practical exercise instructions, online logbooks, instructions and information created by participants will be merged into a comprehensive website that will be available to the community and the public for self-guided training or for use in various educational settings (for example, a graduate course at a university could assign some of the projects as homework or an extra credit project, etc).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="objectives-and-learning-outcomes">Objectives and learning outcomes: </h3>

<p>At the end of the course the students should have a basic understanding of (these will be updated).
More material will be added here.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>

<p>Students and post-doctoral fellows interested in quantum computing
applied to nuclear physics problems, from nuclear structure to quantum
field theories.  The material will be of interest, and accessible, to
both theorists and experimentalists, and will include learning the
practical use of quantum computing software in order to interpret and
study nuclear systems.
</p>

<p>The students are expected to have operating programming skills in in
compiled programming languages like Fortran or C++ or preferentially in  an
interpreted language like Python and knowledge of quantum mechanics at
an intermediate level.

<p>

<p>The target group is Master of Science students, PhD students and early
post-doctoral fellows.  Also senior staff can attend but they have to
be self-supported.  The maximum number of students is 20-30, of which
hopefully at most 15-20 can receive full local support.

<p>

<p>We expect to accept between 20-30 students. Local students from the
University of Trento are fully self-supported.  If approved, we would
very much appreciate if the ECT* can sponsor 15-20 of the selected
students with local expenses, that is lodging and meals during
weekdays. Any additional funds for sponsoring further students is
highly appreciated.
</p>

<p>All travel expenses will be covered by the respective home institute.
Teachers are self-supported. We plan to raise additional funds to
cover local support for additional students and the expenses of the
teachers.
</p>

<p>There is no participation fee. Administrative support from the ECT* in
organizing the course and setting up the application procedure is
essential for a smooth (as always) outcome. The administrative
experience of the staff at the ECT* has been unique and essential in
running successully our previous Talent courses. We would thus highly
appreciate it if these services are provided if the proposal is
approved.
