===== First exercise set =====

The exercises we present each week are meant to build the basis for
the possible  project we will work. See in particular the third lecture today.




!split
===== Ex1: One-qubit basis and  Pauli matrices  =====

Write a function which sets up a one-qubit basis and apply the various Pauli matrices to these basis states.

!split
===== Ex2: Hadamard and Phase gates  =====

Apply the Hadamard and Phase gates to the same one-qubit basis states and study their actions on these states.


!split
===== Ex3: Traces of operators  =====

Prove that the trace is cyclic, that is for three operators $\bm{A}$, $\bm{B}$ and $\bm{C}$, we have
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\{\bm{ABC}\}=\mathrm{Tr}\{\bm{CAB}\}=\mathrm{Tr}\{\bm{BCA}\}.
\]
!et


!split
=====  Ex4: Exponentiated operators =====

Let $\bm{A}$ be an operator on a vector space satisfying $\bm{A}^2=1$ and $\alpha$ any real constant. Show that
!bt
\[
\exp{\imath\alpha \bm{A}}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(i\alpha)^n}{n!}\bm{A}^n=\bm{I}\cos{\alpha}+\imath\bm{A}\sin{\alpha}.
\]
!et
Does this apply to the Pauli matrices?



!split
===== Ex5: Hamiltonians rewritten in terms of simple Pauli matrices =====

We consider a simple $2\times 2$ real
Hamiltonian consisting of a diagonal part $H_0$ and off-diagonal part
$H_I$, playing the roles of a non-interactive one-body and interactive
two-body part respectively. Defined through their matrix elements, we
express them in the Pauli basis $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1 \rangle$

!bt
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split} 
        H &= H_0 + H_I \\
        H_0 = \begin{bmatrix}
            E_1 & 0 \\
            0 & E_2
        \end{bmatrix}&, \hspace{20px}
        H_I = \lambda \begin{bmatrix}
            V_{11} & V_{12} \\
            V_{21} & V_{22}
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
!et
Where $\lambda \in [0,1]$ is a coupling constant parameterizing the strength of the interaction. 

!split
===== Rewriting in terms of Pauli matrices =====

Define
!bt
\[
    E_{+} = \frac{E_1 + E_2}{2},\hspace{20px} E_{-} = \frac{E_1 - E_2}{2}
\]
!et
show  that by combining the identity and $Z$ Pauli matrix, this can be expressed as

!bt
\[
    H_0 = E_{+} I + E_{-} Z
\]
!et

!split
===== The interaction part =====

For $H_1$ we use the same trick to fill the diagonal, defining $V_{+} = (V_{11} + V_{22})/2, V_{-} = (V_{11} - V_{22})/2$. From the hermiticity requirements of $H$, we note that $V_{12} = V_{21} \equiv V_o$. Use this to simplify the problem to a simple $X$ term. 

!bt
\[
    H_I = V_{+} I + V_{-} Z + V_o X
\]
!et

!split
===== Measurement basis =====

For the above system show that the Pauli $X$ matrix can be rewritten in terms of the Hadamard matrices and the Pauli $Z$ matrix, that is
!bt
\[
X=HZH.
\]
!et
