===== Readings =====
* _Reading recommendation_: Scherer, Mathematics of Quantum Computations, parts of chapter 2 and sections 3.1-3.3  and Hundt, Quantum Computing for Programmers, chapter  2.1-2.5. Hundt's text is relevant for the programming part where we build from scratch the ingredients we will need.

Feel free to study the exercises in Scherer's text as well. Solutions are available.

A good read is also Audtresch's text on _Entangled systems_. For density matrices see chapter 4 at URL:"https://github.com/CompPhysics/QuantumComputingMachineLearning/blob/gh-pages/doc/Textbooks/EntanglementBook.pdf"

===== Measurements =====

The probability of a measurement on a quantum system giving a certain
result is determined by the weight of the relevant basis state in the
state vector. After the measurement, the system is in a state that
corresponds to the result of the measurement. The operators and
gates discussed below are examples of operations we can perform on
specific states.


We  consider the state
!bt
\[
\vert \psi\rangle = \alpha \vert 0 \rangle +\beta \vert 1 \rangle
\]
!et

!split
===== Properties of a measurement =====

o A measurement can yield only one of the above states, either $\vert 0\rangle$ or $\vert 1\rangle$.
o The probability of a measurement resulting in $\vert 0\rangle$ is $\alpha^*\alpha = \vert \alpha \vert^2$.
o The probability of a measurement resulting in $\vert 1\rangle$ is $\beta^*\beta = \vert \beta \vert^2$.
o And we note that the sum of the outcomes gives $\alpha^*\alpha+\beta^*\beta=1$ since the two states are normalized.

After the measurement, the state of the system is the state associated with the result of the measurement.

We have already encountered the projection operators $P$ and $Q$. Let
us now look at other types of operations we can make on qubit states.





!split
===== Basic properties of hermitian operators =====

The operators we typically encounter in quantum mechanical studies are
o Hermitian (self-adjoint) meaning that for example the elements of a Hermitian matrix $\bm{U}$ obey $u_{ij}=u_{ji}^*$.
o Unitary $\bm{U}\bm{U}^{\dagger}=\bm{U}^{\dagger}\bm{U}=\bm{I}$, where $\bm{I}$ is the unit matrix
o The operator $\bm{U}$ and its self-adjoint commute (often labeled as normal operators), that is  $[\bm{U},\bm{U}^{\dagger}]=0$. An operator is _normal_ if and only if it is diagonalizable. A Hermitian operator is normal.

Unitary operators in a Hilbert space preserve the norm and orthogonality. If $\bm{U}$ is a unitary operator acting on a state $\vert \psi_j\rangle$, the action of

!bt
\[
\vert \phi_i\rangle=\bm{U}\vert \psi_j\rangle,
\]
!et
preserves both the norm and orthogonality, that is $\langle \phi_i \vert \phi_j\rangle=\langle \psi_i \vert \psi_j\rangle=\delta_{ij}$, as discussed earlier.

!split
===== The Pauli matrices again =====

As example, consider the Pauli matrix $\sigma_x$. We have already seen that this matrix is a unitary matrix. Consider then an orthogonal and normalized basis $\vert 0\rangle^{\dagger} =\begin{bmatrix} 1 &  0\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vert 1\rangle^{\dagger} =\begin{bmatrix} 0 &  1\end{bmatrix}$ and a state which is a linear superposition of these two basis states

!bt
\[
\vert \psi_a\rangle=\alpha_0\vert 0\rangle +\alpha_1\vert 1\rangle.
\]
!et

A new state $\vert \psi_b\rangle$ is given by
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_b\rangle=\sigma_x\vert \psi_a\rangle=\alpha_0\vert 1\rangle +\alpha_1\vert 0\rangle.
\]
!et

!split
===== Spectral Decomposition =====

An important technicality which we will use in the discussion of
density matrices, entanglement, quantum entropies and other properties
is the so-called spectral decomposition of an operator.

Let $\vert \psi\rangle$ be a vector in a Hilbert space of dimension $n$ and a hermitian operator $\bm{A}$ defined in this
space. Assume $\vert \psi\rangle$ is an eigenvector of $\bm{A}$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$, that is

!bt
\[
\bm{A}\vert \psi\rangle = \lambda\vert \psi\rangle = \lambda \bm{I}\vert \psi \rangle,
\]
!et
where we used $\bm{I}\vert \psi \rangle = 1 \vert \psi \rangle$.
Subtracting the right hand side from the left hand side gives
!bt
\[
\left[\bm{A}-\lambda \bm{I}\right]\vert \psi \rangle=0,
\]
!et

which has a nontrivial solution only if the determinant
$\mathrm{det}(\bm{A}-\lambda\bm{I})=0$.

!split
===== ONB again and again =====

We define now an orthonormal basis $\vert i \rangle =\{\vert 0
\rangle, \vert 1\rangle, \dots, \vert n-1\rangle$ in the same Hilbert
space. We will assume that this basis is an eigenbasis of $\bm{A}$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_i$

We expand a new vector using this eigenbasis of $\bm{A}$
!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\vert i\rangle,
\]
!et
with the normalization condition $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\vert \alpha_i\vert^2$.
Acting with $\bm{A}$ on this new state results in

!bt
\[
\bm{A}\vert \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\bm{A}\vert i\rangle=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\lambda_i\vert i\rangle.
\]
!et

!split
===== Projection operators =====

If we then use that the outer product of any state with itself defines a projection operator we have the projection operators
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi} = \vert \psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{j} = \vert j\rangle\langle j\vert,
\]
!et
we have that 
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{j}\vert \psi\rangle=\vert j\rangle\langle j\vert\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\vert i\rangle=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\vert j\rangle\langle j\vert i\rangle.
\]
!et

!split
===== Further manipulations =====

This results in
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{j}\vert \psi\rangle=\alpha_j\vert j\rangle,
\]
!et
since $\langle j\vert i\rangle$.
With the last equation we can rewrite
!bt
\[
\bm{A}\vert \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\lambda_i\vert i\rangle=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\lambda_i\bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle,
\]
!et
from which we conclude that
!bt
\[
\bm{A}=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\lambda_i\bm{P}_i.
\]
!et

!split
===== Spectral decomposition =====

This is the spectral decomposition of a hermitian and normal
operator. It is true for any state and it is independent of the
basis. The spectral decomposition can in turn be used to exhaustively
specify a measurement, as we will see in the next section.

As an example, consider two states $\vert \psi_a\rangle$ and $\vert
\psi_b\rangle$ that are eigenstates of $\bm{A}$ with eigenvalues
$\lambda_a$ and $\lambda_b$, respectively. In the diagonalization
process we have obtained the coefficients $\alpha_0$, $\alpha_1$,
$\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ using an expansion in terms of the orthogonal
basis $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$.

!split
===== Explicit results =====

We have then

!bt
\[
\vert \psi_a\rangle = \alpha_0\vert 0\rangle+\alpha_1\vert 1\rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_b\rangle = \beta_0\vert 0\rangle+\beta_1\vert 1\rangle,
\]
!et
with corresponding projection operators

!bt
\[
\bm{P}_a=\vert \psi_a\rangle \langle \psi_a\vert = \begin{bmatrix} \vert \alpha_0\vert^2 &\alpha_0\alpha_1^* \\
                                                                   \alpha_1\alpha_0^* & \vert \alpha_1\vert^* \end{bmatrix},
\]    
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_b=\vert \psi_b\rangle \langle \psi_b\vert = \begin{bmatrix} \vert \beta_0\vert^2 &\beta_0\beta_1^* \\
                                                                   \beta_1\beta_0^* & \vert \beta_1\vert^* \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== The spectral decomposition =====

The results from the previous slide gives us
the following spectral decomposition of $\bm{A}$
!bt
\[
\bm{A}=\lambda_a \vert \psi_a\rangle \langle \psi_a\vert+\lambda_b \vert \psi_b\rangle \langle \psi_b\vert,
\]
!et
which written out in all its details reads
!bt
\[
\bm{A}=\lambda_a\begin{bmatrix} \vert \alpha_0\vert^2 &\alpha_0\alpha_1^* \\
                                                                   \alpha_1\alpha_0^* & \vert \alpha_1\vert^* \end{bmatrix} +\lambda_b\begin{bmatrix} \vert \beta_0\vert^2 &\beta_0\beta_1^* \\
                                                                   \beta_1\beta_0^* & \vert \beta_1\vert^* \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Bloch sphere =====

Classically, in a binary system, the bits take only two distinct
values, either $0$ or $1$.  The quantum mechanical counterpart is
given by two state vectors (our simple computational basis)
$\vert 0 \rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle $ which can be used to realize the
superposition
!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \alpha \vert 0 \rangle +\beta\vert 1\rangle, 
\]
!et
which can be represented using the so-called Bloch sphere, depicted on the next slide (best seen using the jupyter-notebook).


!split
===== Meet the Bloch sphere =====
The Bloch shere gives a vialable way to visualize a qubit and itsv possible realizations in terms of the angles $0\le \theta \le \pi$ and
$0\le \phi \le 2\pi$. 
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
from qiskit.visualization import plot_bloch_vector
plot_bloch_vector([0,1,0], title="New Bloch Sphere")
!ec
You can use spherical coordinates instead of cartesian ones.
!bc pycod
plot_bloch_vector([1, np.pi/2, np.pi/3], coord_type='spherical')
!ec
Using the Bloch sphere representation of the qubit $\vert \psi \rangle = \alpha \vert 0 \rangle +\beta\vert 1\rangle$, we can rewrite it as
!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \cos{(\frac{\theta}{2})} \vert 0 \rangle +\sin{(\frac{\theta}{2})}\exp{(\imath\phi)}\vert 1\rangle, 
\]
!et


!split
===== Bloch sphere exercise =====

Determine the Bloch sphere angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ for the eigenstates of each Pauli matrix (see lectures from last week for the definition of Pauli matrices).



!split
===== Measurements =====

Armed with the spectral decomposition, we are now ready to discuss how
to compute measurements of observables.  When we make a measurement,
quantum mechanics postulates that mutually exclusive measurement
outcomes correspond to orthogonal projection operators.

We assume now we can contruct a series of such orthogonal operators based on $\vert i \rangle \in \{\vert 0\rangle, \vert 1\rangle,\dots, \vert n-1\rangle$ computational basis states. These projection operators $\bm{P}_0,\bm{P}_1,\dots,\bm{P}_{n-1}$ are all idempotent and sum to one
!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\bm{P}_i=\bm{I}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Qubit example =====

As an example, consider the basis of two qubits $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$ with the correspong sum
!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{1}\bm{P}_i=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
Based on the spectral decomposition discussed above, we can define the probability of eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ as
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Prob}(\lambda_i) = \vert \bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle\vert^2,
\]
!et
where $\vert \psi_a\rangle$ is a quantum state representing the system prior to a specific measurement.

!split
===== Total probability =====

We can rewrite this as 
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Prob}(\lambda_i) = \langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_i^{\dagger}\bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle =\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle.
\]
!et
The total probability for all measurements is the sum overt all probabilities
!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\mathrm{Prob}(\lambda_i)=1.
\]
!et
We can in turn define the post-measurement normalized pure quantum state as, for the specific outcome $\lambda_i$, as
!bt
\[
\vert \psi'\rangle = \frac{\bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \psi \vert \bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle}}. 
\]
!et


!split
===== Binary example system =====

As an example, consider the binary system states $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$ with corresponding projection operators
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_0 =\vert 0 \rangle \langle 0\vert,
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_1 =\vert 1 \rangle \langle 1\vert,
\]
!et
with the properties

!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^1\bm{P}_i^{\dagger}\bm{P}_1=\bm{I},
\]
!et

!bt
\[
\bm{P}_0^{\dagger}\bm{P}_0=\bm{P}_0^2=\bm{P}_0,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_1^{\dagger}\bm{P}_1=\bm{P}_1^2=\bm{P}_1.
\]
!et

!split
===== Superposition of states =====

Assume thereafter that we have a state $\vert \psi\rangle$ which is a superposition of the above two qubit states
!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \alpha\vert 0 \rangle + \beta \vert 1\rangle.
\]
!et
The probability of finding either $\vert 0\rangle$ or $\vert 1\rangle$ is then
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi(0)}=\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_0^{\dagger}\bm{P}_0\vert \psi\rangle=\vert \alpha\vert^2,
\]
!et
and similarly we have 
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi(1)}=\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_1^{\dagger}\bm{P}_1\vert \psi\rangle=\vert \beta\vert^2.
\]
!et
!split
===== More derivations =====

If we set 
!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\vert 0 \rangle + \vert 1\rangle\right),
\]
!et
we have $\vert \alpha\vert^2=\vert \beta\vert^2=1/2$. In general for this system we have
!bt
\[
\vert \psi'_0\rangle = \frac{\bm{P}_0\vert \psi\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \psi \vert \bm{P}_0\vert \psi\rangle}}=\frac{\alpha}{\vert \alpha\vert}\vert 0 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert \psi'_1\rangle = \frac{\bm{P}_1\vert \psi\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \psi \vert \bm{P}_1\vert \psi\rangle}}=\frac{\beta}{\vert \beta\vert}\vert 1 \rangle. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Final result =====
In general we have that 
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi(x)}=\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\vert \psi\rangle,,
\]
!et
which we can rewrite as
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Prob}(\psi(x))=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\vert \psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert\right].
\]
!et

!split
===== Example =====

The last equation can be understood better through the following example with a state $\vert \psi\rangle$

!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \alpha \vert 0\rangle+\beta \vert 1\rangle,
\]
!et
which results in a projection operator
!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle\langle \psi\vert = \begin{bmatrix} \vert \alpha \vert^2 & \alpha\beta^* \\ \alpha^*\beta & \vert\beta\vert^2\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Computing matrix products =====
We have that
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_0^{\dagger}\bm{P}_0=\bm{P}_0=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and computing the matrix product $\bm{P}_0\vert\psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert$ gives
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_0\vert\psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \vert \alpha \vert^2 & \alpha\beta^* \\ \alpha^*\beta & \vert\beta\vert^2\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \vert \alpha \vert^2 & \alpha\beta^* \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Taking the trace =====

Taking the trace of the above matrix, that is computing
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Prob}(\psi(0))=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_0^{\dagger}\bm{P}_0\vert \psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert\right]=\vert \alpha\vert^2,
\]
!et
we obtain the same results as the one we had earlier by computing
the probabliblity for $0$ given by the expression
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi(0)}=\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_0^{\dagger}\bm{P}_0\vert \psi\rangle=\vert \alpha\vert^2.
\]
!et

!split
===== Outcome probability =====

It is straight forward to show that
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Prob}(\psi(1))=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_1^{\dagger}\bm{P}_1\vert \psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert\right]=\vert \beta\vert^2,
\]
!et
which we also could have obtained by computing
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi(1)}=\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_1^{\dagger}\bm{P}_1\vert \psi\rangle=\vert \beta\vert^2.
\]
!et

!split
===== Extending the expressions =====

We can now extend these expressions to the complete ensemble of measurements. Using the spectral decomposition we have that the probability of an outcome $p(x)$ is
!bt
\[
p(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p_i\bm{P}_{\psi_i(x)},
\]
!et
where $p_i$ are the probabilities of a specific outcome. 

With these prerequisites we are now ready to introduce the density  matrices, or density operators.

!split
===== Density matrices/operators =====

The last equation can be rewritten as 

!bt
\[
p(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p_i\bm{P}_{\psi_i(x)}=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p_i\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\vert \psi_i\rangle\langle \psi_i\vert\right],
\]
!et
and we define the _density matrix/operator_ as
!bt
\[
\rho=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p_i\vert \psi_i\rangle\langle \psi_i\vert,
\]
!et
we can rewrite the first equation above as 
!bt
\[
p(x)=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\rho\right].
\]
!et
If we can define the state of a system in terms of the density matrix, the probability of a specific outcome is then given by
!bt
\[
p(x)_{\rho}=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\rho\right].
\]
!et

!split
===== Properties of density matrices =====

A density matrix in a Hilbert space with $n$ states has the following properties (which we state without proof)
o There exists a probability $p_i\geq 0$ with $\sum_ip_i=1$,
o There exists an orthonormal basis $\psi_i$ such that we can define $\rho=\sum_ip_i\vert\psi_i\rangle\langle \psi_i\vert$,
o We have $0 \leq \rho^2\leq 1$ and
o The norm $\vert\vert \rho \vert\vert_2\leq 1$.

With the density matrix we can also define the state the system collapses to after a measurement, namely

!bt
\[
\rho'_x=\frac{\bm{P}_x\rho\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}}{\mathrm{Tr}[\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\rho]}.
\]
!et


!split
===== First entanglement encounter, two qubit system =====

We define a system that can be thought of as composed of two subsystems
$A$ and $B$. Each subsystem has computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}^T \hspace{1cm} \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et
The subsystems could represent single particles or composite many-particle systems of a given symmetry.


!split
===== Computational basis =====

This leads to the many-body computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 00\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 01\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 10\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and finally
!bt
\[
\vert 11\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et


!split
===== Bell states =====

The above computational basis states, which define an ONB, can in turn
be used to define another ONB. As an example, consider the so-called
Bell states

!bt
\[
\vert \Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\vert 00\rangle +\vert 11\rangle\right]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

!bt
\[
\vert \Phi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\vert 00\rangle -\vert 11\rangle\right]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ -1\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

!split
===== The next two  =====

!bt
\[
\vert \Psi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\vert 10\rangle +\vert 01\rangle\right]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

and

!bt
\[
\vert \Psi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\vert 10\rangle -\vert 01\rangle\right]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
It is easy to convince oneself that these states also form an orthonormal basis. 


!split
===== Measurement =====

Measuring one of the qubits of one of the above Bell states,
automatically determines, as we will see below, the state of the
second qubit. To convince ourselves about this, let us assume we perform a measurement on the qubit in system $A$ by introducing the projections with outcomes $0$ or $1$ as

!bt
\[
\bm{P}_0=\vert 0\rangle\langle 0\vert_A\otimes \bm{I}_B=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}\otimes\begin{bmatrix} 1& 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
for the projection of the $\vert 0 \rangle$ state in system $A$ and similarly
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_1=\vert 1\rangle\langle 1\vert_A\otimes \bm{I}_B=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\otimes\begin{bmatrix} 1& 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
for the projection of the $\vert 1 \rangle$ state in system $A$.


!split
===== Probability of  outcome =====

We can then calculate the probability for the various outcomes by
computing for example the probability for measuring qubit $0$ 

!bt
\[
\langle \Phi^+\vert \bm{P}_0\vert \Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \left[\langle 00\vert +\langle 11\vert\right]\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}\left[\vert 00\rangle +\vert 11\rangle\right]=\frac{1}{2}.
\]
!et
Similarly, we obtain
!bt
\[
\langle \Phi^+\vert \bm{P}_1\vert \Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{2}\left[\langle 00\vert +\langle 11\vert\right]\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\left[\vert 00\rangle +\vert 11\rangle\right]=\frac{1}{2}.

===== States after measurement =====
After the above measurements the system is in the states

!bt
\[
\vert \Phi'_0 \rangle = \sqrt{2}\left[\vert 0\rangle\langle 0\vert_A\otimes \bm{I}_B\right]\vert\Phi^+\rangle=\vert 00\rangle,
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\vert \Phi'_1 \rangle = \sqrt{2}\left[\vert 1\rangle\langle 1\vert_A\otimes \bm{I}_B\right]\vert\Phi^+\rangle=\vert 11\rangle.
\]
!et

We see from the last two equations that the state of the second qubit
is determined even though the measurement has only taken place locally
on system $A$.


!split
===== Other states =====

If we on the other hand consider a state like

!bt
\[
\vert 00 \rangle = \vert 0\rangle_A\otimes \vert 0\rangle_B,
\]
!et
this is a pure _product_ state of the single-qubit, or single-particle
states, of two qubits (particles) in system $A$ and system $B$,
respectively. We call such a state for a _pure product state_.  Quantum states
that cannot be written as a mixture of other states are called pure
quantum states or just product states, while all other states are called mixed quantum states.

!split
===== More on Bell states =====
A state like one of the Bell states (where we introduce the subscript $AB$ to indicate that the state is composed of single states from two subsystem)
!bt
\[
\vert \Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\vert 00\rangle_{AB} +\vert 11\rangle_{AB}\right],
\]
!et
is on the other hand a mixed state and we cannot determine whether system $A$ is in a state $0$ or $1$. The above state is a superposition of the states $\vert 00\rangle_{AB}$ and $\vert 11\rangle_{AB}$ and it is not possible to determine individual states of systems $A$ and $B$, respectively.


!split
===== Entanglement =====

We say that the state is entangled. This yields the following
definition of entangled states: a pure bipartite state $\vert
\psi\rangle_{AB}$ is entangled if it cannot be written as a product
state $\vert\psi\rangle_{A}\otimes\vert\phi\rangle_B$ for any choice
of the states $\vert\psi\rangle_{A}$ and $\vert\phi\rangle_B$. Otherwise we say the state is separable.


!split
===== Examples of entanglement =====

As an example, considere an ansatz for the ground state of the helium
atom with two electrons in the lowest $1s$ state (hydrogen-like
orbits) and with spin $s=1/2$ and spin projections $m_s=-1/2$ and
$m_s=1/2$.  The two single-particle states are given by the tensor
products of their spatial $1s$ single-particle states
$\vert\phi_{1s}\rangle$ and and their spin up or spin down spinors
$\vert\xi_{sm_s}\rangle$. The ansatz for the ground state is given by a Slater
determinant with total orbital momentum $L=l_1+l_2=0$ and totalt spin
$S=s_1+s_2=0$, normally labeled as a spin-singlet state.

!split
===== Ground state of helium =====
This ansatz
for the ground state is then written as, using the compact notations
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_{i}\rangle = \vert\phi_{1s}\rangle_i\otimes \vert \xi\rangle_{s_im_{s_i}}=\vert 1s,s,m_s\rangle_i,  \]
!et
with $i$ being electron $1$ or $2$, and the tensor product of the two single-electron states as
$\vert 1s,s,m_s\rangle_1\vert 1s,s,m_s\rangle_2=\vert 1s,s,m_s\rangle_1\otimes \vert 1s,s,m_s\rangle_2$, we arrive at
!bt
\[
\Psi(\bm{r}_1,\bm{r}_2;s_1,s_2)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\vert 1s,1/2,1/2\rangle_1\vert 1s,1/2,-1/2\rangle_2-\vert 1s,1/2,-1/2\rangle_1\vert 1s,1/2,1/2\rangle_2\right].
\]
!et
This is also an example of a state which cannot be written out as a pure state. We call this for an entangled state as well.


!split
===== Maximally entangled =====

A so-called maximally entangled state for a bipartite system has equal  probability amplitudes
!bt
\[
\vert \Psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\vert ii\rangle.
\]
!et

We call a bipartite state composed of systems $A$ and $B$ (these
systems can be single-particle systems, or single-qubit systems
representing low-lying states of complicated many-body systems) for
separable if its density matrix $\rho_{AB}$ can be written out as the
tensor product of the individual density matrices $\rho_A$ and
$\rho_B$, that is we have for a given probability distribution $p_i$

!bt
\[
\rho_{AB}=\sum_ip_i\rho_A(i)\otimes \rho_B(i).
\]
!et

===== Second exercise set =====


We bring back the  last two exercises from last week as they are meant to build the basis for
the two projects we will work on during the semester.  The first
project deals with implementing the so-called
_Variational Quantum Eigensolver_ algorithm for finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of selected Hamiltonians.

!split
===== Ex1: One-qubit basis and  Pauli matrices  =====

Write a function which sets up a one-qubit basis and apply the various Pauli matrices to these basis states.

!split
===== Ex2: Hadamard and Phase gates  =====

Apply the Hadamard and Phase gates to the same one-qubit basis states and study their actions on these states.


!split
===== Ex3: Traces of operators  =====

Prove that the trace is cyclic, that is for three operators $\bm{A}$, $\bm{B}$ and $\bm{C}$, we have
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\{\bm{ABC}\}=\mathrm{Tr}\{\bm{CAB}\}=\mathrm{Tr}\{\bm{BCA}\}.
\]
!et


!split
=====  Ex4: Exponentiated operators =====

Let $\bm{A}$ be an operator on a vector space satisfying $\bm{A}^2=1$ and $\alpha$ any real constant. Show that
!bt
\[
\exp{\imath\alpha \bm{A}}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(i\alpha)^n}{n!}\bm{A}^n=\bm{I}\cos{\alpha}+\imath\bm{A}\sin{\alpha}.
\]
!et
Does this apply to the Pauli matrices?

!split
===== Ex5: Reduced density operators I =====

For each of the Bell states, find the reduced density operator/matrix for each qubit.

!split
===== Ex6: Reduced density operators II =====

Suppose we have a composite system which consists of systems $A$ and
$B$ in the state $\vert a\rangle \otimes \vert b\rangle$, where $\vert
a\rangle $ is a pure state of system $A$ and $\vert b\rangle$ is a
pure state of system $B$. Show that the reduced density operator of
system $A$ alone is a pure state. What about system $B$?
