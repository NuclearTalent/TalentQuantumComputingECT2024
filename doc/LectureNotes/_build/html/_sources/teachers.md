# Instructors
- Alexei Bazavov at Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. He is a theoretical particle physicist specializing in study of strongly coupled theories, in particular, Quantum Chromodynamics. Items of particular interest to him include quantum computing and algorithms, quantum field theory, finite-temperature field theory, lattice gauge theory with applications to particle and nuclear physics, parallel algorithms, iterative solvers, molecular dynamics algorithms, inverse problems and Bayesian inference, ultra-cold atomic systems and quantum simulations and effective field theory.

- Zohreh Davoudi at Department of Physics and Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS), University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA. Davoudi is an expert in lattice QCD for nuclear physics. She further specializes in quantum simulation and computing for quantum field theories, including lattice gauge theories and effective field theories of nuclear physics.

- Morten Hjorth-Jensen at Facility for Rare Isotope Beams and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA and Department of Physics, University of Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway. Hjorth-Jensen has his background in studies of different many-body theories applied to problems in nuclear physics and condensed matter physics. He works also on quantum engineering and machine learning applied to many-body systems. He has over many years developed introductory and advanced learning material in many-body physics, quantum computing, computational physics and machine learning.

- Dean Lee at Facility for Rare Isotope Beams and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. His research is focused on connecting fundamental physics to forefront experiments. He studies many aspects of quantum few- and many-body systems. Together with collaborators, he has developed lattice Monte Carlo methods that probe strongly-interacting systems and study superfluidity, nuclear clustering, phase transitions, and other emergent phenomena from first principles. He  is also engaged in novel applications of new technologies for scientific research. This includes new algorithms for quantum computing and the development of emulators and machine learning algorithms based on concepts such as eigenvector continuation.
- Ryan LaRose at Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. He does research in computational physics and quantum information science. He is  interested in both the physics of computation and the computation of physics - that is, what quantum physics can tell us about information and computer science, and how quantum computers can solve practical problems in physics and related fields.

- Alessandro Roggero, Department of Physics, University of Trento, Povo, 38123 Trento, Italy. He works on  simulations of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems using a combination of classical techniques and calculations on quantum devices. In particular, in understanding the role of entanglement in both observable properties of physical systems and as a fundamental tool to understand the structure of many-body states. His research interests include quantum simulations of inelastic nuclear processes, neutrinos in dense matter, quantum computing and algorithms, quantum Monte Carlo methods and effective field theory.

Morten Hjorth-Jensen Alessandro Roggero will also function as student advisors and coordinators.
