# Quantum Computing for Nuclear Physics

This site contains educational material and the pertinent proposal for a Nuclear Talent course on Quantum Computing for Nuclear Physics at the European Center for Theoretical Nuclear Physics, Trento, Italy.
The material will be updated when the school is approved.
Most of the educational material will be available from early 2025.
The Nuclear Talent course is scheduled to start June 16 and end July 4 of 2025. More information about deadlines etc will be posted here in due time.

# Course content and detailed plan for lectures

The first week focuses, after a reminder of central linear algebra
elements, on basic ingredients of quantum computing such as rewriting
quantum mechanical operations as quantum gates and circuits, how to
perform measurements and how to obtain eigenvalues of selected
Hamiltonians.


To obtain the eigenvalues we will discuss the quantum
phase estimation algorithm (which requires a discussion of Quantum
Fourier transforms) and the widely used variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE). After having introduced some simpler Hamiltonians
defined by various Pauli matrices, we will demonstrate how to rewrite
a widely used Hamiltonian given by a second-quantized representation
in terms of various Pauli matrices. The Hamiltonian we will focus on
the first week is Lipkin Hamiltonian which does not require
a so-called Jordan-Wigner transformation. This transformation will
be discussed during the second week.  The students will work on
analytical exercises as well as computational exercises. The latter
will focus on developing a code which implements the VQE method for
finding the eigenvalues of the above Hamiltonians.  The Rodeo algorithm will also be discussed. This code can be
extended upon and can be used to define a final project students can
hand in for final credits.

Many of the topics discussed during the first week, will serve as
background material for the next two weeks.

The second week starts with a discussion of product formulae such as
the Lie-Trotter-Suzuki approximation and how to simulate Hamiltonian
dynamics.  Thereafter we discuss in detail how to encode fermionic and
bosonic systems through for example the so-called Jordan-Wigner
transformation. This will allow us to study more general Hamiltonians
such as a pionless EFT based Hamiltonian and nuclear response function
and neutrino dynamics.  Entanglement in nuclear many-body systems will
also be discussed before we wrap up the week with a discussion of
noise mitigation and quantum error correction algorithms.

Given the more general Hamiltonians, the codes developed during the
first week can be extended to include more Hamiltonians and systems of
relevance for nuclear physics.

Depending on our progress during the first two weeks, the schedule of
the last week may be subject to changes. The tentative plan for the
final week is to dedicate it a discussion of quantum computing for
quantum (gauge) field theories. Here the learning outcomes will focus
on quantum simulations of scattering in scalar field theory,
Hamiltonian formulations of gauge theories and time evolution in gauge
theories, Abelian and non-Abelian, with final applications. The course
ends with a summary and discussions of the projects.
