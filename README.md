# Quantum Computing for Nuclear Physics

This site contains educational material and the pertinent proposal for a Nuclear Talent course on Quantum Computing for Nuclear Physics at the European Center for Theoretical Nuclear Physics, Trento, Italy.
The material will be updated when the school is approved.
Most of the educational material will be available from early 2025.
The Nuclear Talent course is scheduled to start June 16 and end July 4 of 2025. More information about deadlines etc will be posted here in due time.
