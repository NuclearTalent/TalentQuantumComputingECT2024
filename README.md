The second week starts with a discussion of product formulae such as
the Lie-Trotter-Suzuki approximation and how to simulate Hamiltonian
dynamics.  Thereafter we discuss in detail how to encode fermionic and
bosonic systems through for example the so-called Jordan-Wigner
transformation. This will allow us to study more general Hamiltonians
such as a pionless EFT based Hamiltonian and nuclear response function
and neutrino dynamics.  Entanglement in nuclear many-body systems will
also be discussed before we wrap up the week with a discussion of
noise mitigation and quantum error correction algorithms.

Given the more general Hamiltonians, the codes developed during the
first week can be extended to include more Hamiltonians and systems of
relevance for nuclear physics.

Depending on our progress during the first two weeks, the schedule of
the last week may be subject to changes. The tentative plan for the
final week is to dedicate it a discussion of quantum computing for
quantum (gauge) field theories. Here the learning outcomes will focus
on quantum simulations of scattering in scalar field theory,
Hamiltonian formulations of gauge theories and time evolution in gauge
theories, Abelian and non-Abelian, with final applications. The course
ends with a summary and discussions of the projects.
